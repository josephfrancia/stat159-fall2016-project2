## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our intention for this project is to evaluate the predictive power of the following five regressions: Least-Squares regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Principal Component regression, and Partial Least-Squares regression.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we ran any sort of regression on the dataset, we first engaged in some exploratory data analysis by making histograms, boxplots, and summary statistics for the variables in our dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
