#README
--
This project performs several different types of regression analysis on the [credit.csv](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv) data set 

##Directories
- code
  - contains all the scripts and functions used to perform the regression as well as generate RData files and images
- data
  - contains the credit data as well as other data generated by scripts in code
- images
  - contains all the images generated by scripts in code
- slides
  - contains all the slides
- report
  -contains all the sections to generate the report, in the sections directory 
   


##Makefile
There are several targets in the makefile that generate this report

- all
	- running make all will cause all relevant data to be downloaded, analysis to be performed, and report to be generated. the relevant report outputs, report.pdf and slides.html, will be in the top directory
- data
	- downloads credit data and runs cleaning script on data, all output is stored in data directory
- eda
	- runs exploratory analysis on data, producing images and RData files in data and images directory. 
	- WARNING: "make data" must be run before "make eda" is ran
- regressions
	- performs regressions of type: ols, pcr, plsr, lasso and ridge on data. individual regressions can be performed by calling make with aforementioned regression types. 
	- WARNING: "make data" must be run before "make regressions" or any specific regression is run
- compare
	- runs a script which compares the results of all regressions putting relevant data and images in the data and images directories respectively.
	- WARNING: "make data" and "make regressions" must be run in that order before "make compare" is called
- report
	- takes sections in report directory and knits and combines them and generates a report pdf in the top-directory
	- WARNING: "make data", "make regressions" and "make compare" must be run in that order before "make report" is called
- slides
	- generates a slides.html file in top-directory from files in the slides directory
	- WARNING: "make data" and "make regressions" must be run in that order before "make slides"
- session
	- will generate all version information of programs and libraries used in project to stdout	
- clean
	-	deletes all generated files from running make all, to properly delete files run make all then make clean
